### Salut 👋🏻

I am a member of the **PHP community** for a long time now. I also have created tons of popular open-source packages such as PHP Insights, Laravel Zero, Collision, Larastan, and more.

Visit my GitHub page here: **github.com/nunomaduro**

I have a close relationship with the Laravel community, the most popular PHP framework in the world, as I have contributed to the core of the framework. Last year, I have spoken at 11 different countries, including conferences such as PHP Serbia, Laracon EU, ForumPHP France, or Laravel Live India.

See my talks here: **nunomaduro.com/talks**

I am currently maintaining the open-source API clients and integrations at Algolia, where I have developed  Python, PHP, and JavaScript projects, including an JavaScript API Client that is now in the top 20 of your most downloaded packages in the world accordingly to jsDelivr.
