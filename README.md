### Salut üëãüèª

I am a member of the **PHP community** for a long time now. I also have created tons of popular open-source packages such as PHP Insights, Laravel Zero, Collision, Larastan, and more.

Visit my GitHub page here: **github.com/nunomaduro**

I have a close relationship with the Laravel community, the most popular PHP framework in the world, as I have contributed to the core of the framework. Last year, I have spoken at 11 different countries, including conferences such as PHP Serbia, Laracon EU, ForumPHP France, or Laravel Live India.

See my talks here: **nunomaduro.com/talks**

I am currently maintaining the open-source API clients and integrations at Algolia, where I have developed  Python, PHP, and JavaScript projects, including an JavaScript API Client that is now in the top 20 of your most downloaded packages in the world accordingly to jsDelivr.

And I am a close relative of Superman. He wrote the source code.
